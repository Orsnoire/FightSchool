Fight Test 1 – Bug Tracker & Fix Plan (updated as of v 0.05).
________________________________________
📋 Bugs Reported
B1 — Combat mechanics lag / stall until page refresh (FIXED)
B2 — Fireball streaks & potions cause lag with 28 players (FIXED)
B3 — Loot window:  “failure to claim loot” (ONGOING)
•	Severity: P1 (progression blocked; morale impact)
•	Repro: After victory, player attempts to claim loot, gets an error “Item ID does not exist” and “fight ID does not exist” in a modular window (that is a correct error, but shouldn’t be showing up for normal looting).
•	Hypothesis: fight and item IDs are not properly registering in the database.
•	Proposed solution: validate database
•	Acceptance criteria: A given player, when clicking on a loot item, and clicking on the get loot button, then is returned to the lobby and that equipment shows up in their inventory area on the lobby screen.
B4 — Player side icons too large; start position should be at top (boss image area) (ONGOING)
•	Severity: P3 (UX)
•	Repro: On low-resolution chromebooks, the enemy image takes up most of the screen, and doesn’t leave room for the modal window or the display of the two-columns on each side of the screen.
•	Expected: at least 5/8ths of the screen, in a rectangle in the center of the screen, is reserved for modal windows.
•	Proposed fix: make all of the graphics vector so that they resize on different (especially small) resolutions. Allow the graphics to scale down.
•	Acceptance criteria: On low-resolution chromebooks, the player healthbar, enemy healthbar, and modular windows all show up in the center rectangle of the screen, and the two columns of small-sized avatars w/ heath bars show up on either side of that center rectangle.
B5 — Phase change modular windows (modals) don’t match question window positions/sizes (FIXED)
B6 — Unanswered players not marked wrong (FIXED)
B7 — Cross-class abilities not displaying at level 8 (unclear, not tested in 0.05)
•	Severity: P2 (progression / feedback issue)
•	Repro: When players level to 8, cross-class abilities fail to appear in the ability list or UI overlay.
•	Expected: New cross-class abilities unlock and display automatically upon level-up.
•	Hypotheses:
o	Client not updating ability map after level-up event.
o	Server not returning full merged ability list for new level tier.
o	Missing asset mapping for cross-class ability IDs.
•	Acceptance criteria: All level 8 unlocks show in ability bar immediately upon level-up.
B8 — Class change interactive not appearing (FIXED)
B9 — Fight instances not closing / stale sockets persisting (FIXED)
B10 — Teacher dashboard not updating with player logins and statistics (not tested)
•	Severity: P1 (visibility / reporting failure) ONGOING
•	Repro: Teacher stats and players screens stay empty as players have connected; stats not updating after fights.
•	Expected: “Class Statistics” page and “Students” modular shows historical players and updates stats after victory.
•	Fix: Test whether statistics are getting recorded in the database after fights, and whether the teacher ID field is getting called correctly for the statistics page and students page
•	Acceptance criteria: Dashboard lists players after victory; stats populate automatically after victory; no missing or duplicate entries.
B11 — Enemies not taking damage after recent fixSeverity: P0 (hard stop – combat broken) FIXED
B13 — “End fight” pressed but fight doesn’t end; students remain connected
Severity: P0 (lifecycle teardown broken) FIXED
