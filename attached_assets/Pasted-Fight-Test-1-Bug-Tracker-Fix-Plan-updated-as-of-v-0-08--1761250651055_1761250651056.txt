Fight Test 1 ‚Äì Bug Tracker & Fix Plan (updated as of v 0.08).
________________________________________
Updated from 0.07:
-	Aggro system
üìã Bugs Reported
B1 ‚Äî Cross-class abilities not displaying at level 8 (unclear, not tested in 0.07)
‚Ä¢	Severity: P2 (progression / feedback issue)
‚Ä¢	Repro: When players level to 8, cross-class abilities fail to appear in the ability list or UI overlay.
‚Ä¢	Expected: New cross-class abilities unlock and display automatically upon level-up.
‚Ä¢	Hypotheses:
o	Client not updating ability map after level-up event.
o	Server not returning full merged ability list for new level tier.
o	Missing asset mapping for cross-class ability IDs.
‚Ä¢	Acceptance criteria: All level 8 unlocks show in ability bar immediately upon level-up.
B2 ‚Äî Teacher dashboard not updating with player logins and statistics (ONGOING) *updated for 0.08* Statistics are showing, but players are not.
‚Ä¢	Severity: P1 (visibility / reporting failure) 
‚Ä¢	Repro: Players screen stays empty as players have connected
‚Ä¢	Expected: ‚ÄúStudents‚Äù modular shows historical players and updates stats after victory.
‚Ä¢	Fix: Propose to eliminate the ‚ÄúStudents‚Äù screen, as I‚Äôm not sure it will serve a purpose.
‚Ä¢	Acceptance criteria: Dashboard lists players after victory; stats populate automatically after victory; no missing or duplicate entries.
B3 ‚Äì Enemies not changing on consecutive mode (FIXED)
B4 ‚Äì Players are not disconnecting correctly upon clicking ‚ÄúEnd Fight‚Äù on the teacher console. (FIXED)
B5 ‚Äì Players do not have a scroll bar for the select target for blocking/healing. (FIXED)
B6 ‚Äì Host is freezing/stopping after a few rounds of combat (NEW)
‚Ä¢	Severity: P0
‚Ä¢	Repro: After starting a fight, the host screen stops updating after 3-4 rounds of combat. Could be an internet instability issue on my end. Will test on other connections.
‚Ä¢	Expected: Host screen continues to stay connected and updating even with 10+ minutes of sustained combat.
‚Ä¢	Fix: Propose to give a refresh button at the top of the players widget, that will not refresh the page, and keep websockets as they are, and not ask for a new websocket/sessionID, but will merely reconnect to the session in progress.
‚Ä¢	Acceptance criteria: Fights are able to be refreshed and to see the current status of the fight.
B7 ‚Äì Students are losing the ability to answer questions or have their client respond (lag out) (NEW)
‚Ä¢	Severity: P1 (normally would be P0, but can be resolved by a client webpage refresh)
‚Ä¢	Repro: After a few rounds of combat (3-4), student screens begin to lag.
‚Ä¢	Expected: Client screens are able to refresh and keep up with the current phase of combat.
‚Ä¢	Fix: Propose to have a background refresh of variables after each round of combat for each client. The program should be tracked server-side anyway, I‚Äôm not sure whether either the students or hosts should need to keep track of variables.
‚Ä¢	Acceptance criteria: Students can stay at the current phase of combat throughout the full fight.
B8 ‚Äì Students are occasionally finding questions that make the question window cut off their ability checkmarks. (NEW)
‚Ä¢	Severity: P1
‚Ä¢	Repro: A question that exceeds the screen real estate doesn‚Äôt show the full question window
‚Ä¢	Expected: Window is fully viewable (either by resizing or a scroll bar) to see the question and any ability checks.
‚Ä¢	Fix: Add a scroll bar to question windows that exceed screen real estate.
