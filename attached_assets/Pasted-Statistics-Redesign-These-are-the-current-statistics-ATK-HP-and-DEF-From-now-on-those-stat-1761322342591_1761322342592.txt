Statistics Redesign:
-	These are the current statistics: ATK, HP and DEF
-	From now on, those statistics are defunct.
-	As part of the statistics refactoring, I would want the current character display to display all current stat values (including adjustments from gear), and all of the current build’s active and passive abilities.
-	As part of the refactoring, I think the cleanest way is to have the current class pull from the database based on the passives unlocked by their current progress, rather than save up bonuses from levels and save them onto the character database.
-	(in my opinion) the character database for a given player should have only the levels achieved for each available job, and whether that player has looted each loot item.
New statistics:
-	STR: Strength. Adds damage to physical attacks
-	INT: Intelligence. Adds MP and damage to magical attacks
-	AGI: Agility. Adds damage to ranged attacks. Reduces damage agro by AGI.
-	MND: Mind. Adds MP and healing to spells, and healing damage to attacks
-	VIT: Vitality. Reduces damage by VIT/2 points and adds VIT HP to starting HP.
-	HP: Hit Points. Job starting HP + VIT.
-	MP: Magic Points. (INT + MND)x3
-	DEF: Defense. Reduces damage by DEF points.
-	ATK: Attack. Raises melee damage by ATK points.
-	MAT: Magic Attack. Raises magic damage by MAT points.
-	RTK: Ranged Attack. Raises ranged attack damage by RTK points.
-	Combo Points: Only visible on a class that uses combo points. Starting Max Combo Points = AGI*2. It shows up as a different resource under the HP (empty circles when not stored, and add 1 for each round damage is dealt).
Base job beginning stats (THESE ARE NOT TO BE AWARDED AS PASSIVE STAT BONUSES):
-	Warrior: HP 15 VIT 1 STR 1
-	Wizard: HP 7 INT 2
-	Scout: HP 7 AGI 2
-	Herbalist: HP 10 MND 1

Expanded Job Leveling Design Overview (Levels 1–15)
Each job gains abilities at key milestones and stat improvements in between. Every class has 4 total abilities (Level 1, 4, 10, 12, 15) and 6 total stat upgrades spread across the non-ability levels. Levels 8 and the five remaining levels modify or enhance existing abilities.
Job level requirements are listed next to the job name.
New mechanic: upon the first time a player enters the lobby after the job requirements are met, that job will show up in a modular window with a toast and shiny graphic animation behind the new job. 
New lobby load logic: Check all current job levels. Check level requirements for advanced jobs. If advanced job requirements are met, employ the new mechanic.
